DO NOT run this on the human servers when it is not working. The reason bots were banned on the human server was due to poor/crashing/afk/random-move bots taking up games on the human server which led to boring games and wasted peoples time. Do not contribute to that problem. Get everything working on the bot server, and get your bot up to par where it is at least challenging to play against for some humans before even considering running it on the Human server. Thank you!
