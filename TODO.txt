FIX FFA COLORS OMG

IN HIGH CITY COUNT / LARGE MAP VISION SCENARIOS 
	BOT SHOULD ____NOT____ KEEP ATTACKING FROM ITS KING, IT SHOULD INSTEAD GATHER TO SOME GREATEST ATTACK PATH AND LAUNCH FROM THERE
	STOP GIVING AWAY YOUR KING POSITION AND NOT USING THE REST OF THE MAP ARMY YOU POS
	IF WINNING BY DECENT MARGIN, BOT SHOULD KEEP ARMY ON ITS KING AND REFUSE TO ATTACK FROM THE KING WITHOUT MOVE-HALF

Fix bot to not send full-attacks during last few turns before army bonus, esp early game. Bot should spend the last few turns expanding, always, not attacking.

Fix. Fucking. Gathers. Knapsack greedy?
*Deprioritize Cities in gathers
	Also fix gathers to not gather obnoxiously small amounts of army
Gathers with Knapsack to optimize gathering the most army in X turns
	First 25: find MST gather-type-thing that optimizes expanding (both the gathering to borders, and the expansion paths over neutral tiles)
		ehhhh current first 25 is ok enough

BFS from enemy king approx / location to find nearest tile to bots king that enemy army can reach without bot getting vision of inc army
	That way we can attack at this tile to increase defense time, and refuse to move large armies further than this tiles distance away

When killpath against our king goes through non-visible tiles, make sure our defense path is set at least as long as the number of non-visible tiles that killpath goes through (so that we don't drop defense moves when attacking army goes out of sight)

When losing on tiles, gather to target enemy tiles along with gather-path like old bot did

Consider more than one threat per turn (enemy has 29 army and a 100 army behind that one, if the 29 army is a threat the real 129 threat is ignored)

Stop undiscovered-kill attacking target enemies who are bigger than bot in FFA game - Just gets bot killed

Fix path turn stuff (trying to re-move tiles that are already moved, re-moving move-halfs, etc)

* SWITCH TO BFS FOR DEFENSE GATHER, FUCK THIS HEURISTIC SHIT
	* Gather to general AND threat tile that is 1 away from general. 
	* (Determine if multiple paths to gen exist?)


Do - Until - Then ~~~
	Class based? Early terminations?

	gather at found general until dead?

Tile restrictions + tile restriction tracker class
	tile cannot move in x direction, tile can only move half in x direction, etc


*Find-Path between two tiles (to gather to)
	Find-path containing cities, or closest to cities?
		* containing cities + enemy tiles done
	*Stop gathering directly to general, instead gather between general and target general / general approx


Dynamic Programming gathers for defense, stop re-evaluating gathers per-turn (maybe?)

Remove general army restrictions in leu of keeping enough army near general
	breadth gather (will kill work? What did I mean by this oh no)
	* Removed general restrictions lel, no 'near general' calculations
